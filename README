This project is the web redirector for SignalFlare, an app for iOS (currently) and Android (coming soon).  This code is in the public domain. It's not that complex, and it's a minimalist example of getting a Sinatra app running on Heroku.

The project basically consists of a Sinatra app that simply takes a simple request with encoded Latitude & Longitude and redirects the request to Google Maps. 

An example might make this easier to understand. Given a request like this:

http://sgnl.ws/1PQXr/-325jx

this app will decode that and redirect you to 

http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.761957,-72.741863

That's basically it. There is a test command and a encode command as well. See the signal_parser.rb file for more details.
